# Perl 'exists' function and undefined values

This example demonstrates a potential issue with Perl's `exists` function. The `exists` function only checks if a key is present in a hash, not whether the corresponding value is defined.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if you are relying on the value being defined.

The `bug.pl` file contains the buggy code, which incorrectly assumes that `exists` checks for both key presence and a defined value. The `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that uses defined to correctly check for both key existence and defined values.
